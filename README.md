# Johny's Portfolio

A very dedicated and thirsty-for-knowledge software engineer. Having worked on web and Mobile applications, my work has continually improved after every project. I always try to keep the code readable, reusable, and maintainable. If a project needs a specific tool or framework I do not have knowledge of it, I will try my best to study it until I am confident with it.

## Tech stack

React, React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, Nextjs, Expressjs, Git, AWS, Salesforce.
